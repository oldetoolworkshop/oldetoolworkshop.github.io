That is quite the interesting channel. I also make 3D printed tools, but I don&#039;t use them for woodoking. I find  I like more traditional tools for my woodworking. I do use them for other less demanding tasks, like in my electronics workshop. Here are some examples of my creations on Printables.com 

Ruler Combination Square attachment

Sliding Bevel

Center Finder

As to the smoother plane, in my experience, a 3D printer smoother plane would not be strong or precise enough to use on wood. Smoothers are the most demanding planes and therefore need very fine tuning to work correctly. But please don&#039;t let me stop you, I have been wrong before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For some time now I&#039;ve been following this fellow on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@AllanMacMillan

He&#039;s interested in creating totally functional 3d-printed tools - considering many historical tools were made from wood, it makes sense that their designs might translate well to 3d printing. His grooving plane and router plane are the most impressive to me, though the saw handle is handy considering how many old saws I come across with broken horns. The eggbeater drill is a beauty, but I can&#039;t imagine it having the torque to do much.

For some time now I&#039;ve considered printing an entire coffin smoother, just to see how it would work. But I haven&#039;t actually dug into how to model the thing, particularly the mortise.

Thanks for the post! Good to file away another useful tidbit for my printer.]]></description>
