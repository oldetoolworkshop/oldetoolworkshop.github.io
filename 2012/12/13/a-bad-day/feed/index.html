					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://oldetoolworkshop.com/2012/12/13/a-bad-day/#comment-554&quot;&gt;John Brier&lt;/a&gt;.

John, thanks for the words of encouragement.  As with any labor of love it is a joy to share.   I have always liked woodworking.  As a young kid I was always building stuff.  It just took until I was much older to rediscover something that had been within me since those early years.  Hope you can pursue your interest soon.  If I had started in my late twenties,  I might be actually good by now lol.  Let me know if you want any information or advice and I will be glad to share.

					<description><![CDATA[Aaron, really cool that you are into wood working. My Dad has built countless useful things from a coat hanger to a desk to a small &quot;shack&quot; or shed which he works in and stores things. I respect the hobby greatly and hope to one day join the ranks. Also your writing is good. I enjoyed the last line in this blog. keep it up.]]></description>
