<p>This project has taken way too long to finish (my first post was on Sep. 15, 2015). This bench deserved better from me. I am on the home stretch now and only have a few tasks left. I have made a commitment to myself to finish this project before the New Year (to be exact, New Year’s Day 2021, there are some members on my family that need that specific of a date declaration.) Here is a casual non-exhaustive, non-binding list of things to finish:</p>



<p>o Make and install deadman <br>o Level the tops, make sure they are shimmed and ready for mounting to base <br>o Install barrel nuts on the top slabs<br>o This is embarrassing, but put front dovetailed veneer piece to cover trim sawing disaster (more on this later)<br>o Install a Roubo-style bench stop made by <a href="https://www.peterrossblacksmith.com/">Peter Ross</a>. This was a late addition after careful consideration and desire to have more work holding options<br>o Pre-finish cleanup of all surfaces<br>o Make a new center board as the old one was just temporary  <br>o Finish the bench<br>o Enjoy!</p>



<p>All in all, not that much work remaining considering all I have put into this project. I have used and continue to use this bench. I LOVE IT!  Best thing I have ever built by a long shot. My second workbench (if I build another) will not take nearly as long. </p>



<p>This is one of the truly good things to come out of the Covid-19 lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will write a lessons learned post after I have finished the workbench. I wish I had gotten a copy of the “<a href="https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-workbench">Anarchists Workbench</a>” (The PDF is free to download &#8220;And it’s covered by a creative commons license that allows you to use the material however you like for non-commercial purposes.&#8221;) before building this bench, but I am very happy with the workbench I have built and it will serve me well for the rest of my life. One thing I do regret is buying a commercial workbench for $500. I bought that bench before I “knew better” but that is a cop out. I should have done more research, even back then before laying out that much money. Also, I had seen <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/woodwrights-shop-french-work-bench-part-1/">Roy Underhill build his workbench</a> on the “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop/">Woodwright’s Shop</a>” years before, but did not think I had the skills to build one myself. </p>



<p>Never underestimate your abilities! You can do it. Yes, you will make mistakes, I made LOTS of them. </p>



<p>Build<br>Fail<br>Try Again<br>Fail<br>Build Some More<br>SUCCEED!</p>



<p>This the way.</p>



<p>You will figure out how to fix mistakes and you can complete the project if you stick to it. I love to work on problems, and this build gave me no shortage of them. I love to innovate and my solution for the right front bench dog ejector “<a href="https://oldetoolworkshop.com/2020/05/15/teaching-a-new-dog-old-tricks/">Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks</a>&#8221; was  particularly satisfying. </p>



<p>Here are some adjectives to describe this project in no particular order &#8211; Fun, Strenuous, Challenging, Frustrating, Satisfying, Educational, Joy, Sorrow, Ingenious.</p>



<p>Peace,</p>
