					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://oldetoolworkshop.com/2023/06/09/a-marriage-of-convenience/#comment-2709&quot;&gt;reed&lt;/a&gt;.

That is quite the interesting channel. I also make 3D printed tools, but I don&#039;t use them for woodoking. I find  I like more traditional tools for my woodworking. I do use them for other less demanding tasks, like in my electronics workshop. Here are some examples of my creations on Printables.com 

Ruler Combination Square attachment
https://www.printables.com/model/273613-combination-square-for-flat-rulers

Sliding Bevel 
https://www.printables.com/model/278834-sliding-bevel-replica-of-stanley-10-no-25-bevel

Center Finder
https://www.printables.com/model/279289-center-finder-with-circle-templates

As to the smoother plane, in my experience, a 3D printer smoother plane would not be strong or precise enough to use on wood. Smoothers are the most demanding planes and therefore need very fine tuning to work correctly. But please don&#039;t let me stop you, I have been wrong before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For some time now I&#039;ve been following this fellow on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@AllanMacMillan

He&#039;s interested in creating totally functional 3d-printed tools - considering many historical tools were made from wood, it makes sense that their designs might translate well to 3d printing. His grooving plane and router plane are the most impressive to me, though the saw handle is handy considering how many old saws I come across with broken horns. The eggbeater drill is a beauty, but I can&#039;t imagine it having the torque to do much.

For some time now I&#039;ve considered printing an entire coffin smoother, just to see how it would work. But I haven&#039;t actually dug into how to model the thing, particularly the mortise.

Thanks for the post! Good to file away another useful tidbit for my printer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI Todd,

Thanks for the kind words about my shop.  As to my shop being clean,  it does get messy.  I usually clean between major parts of a project and at the end of the day.  For finding tools,  you may have some luck at Flea Markets or even Craigslist.  That is where I have scored some pretty nice deals.  I am very fortunate to have the Wood Wright School and Ed Lebetkin&#039;s tool store so close (40 min) .  I can definitely see where a spring pole lathe would present some challenges to you.  I love the spring pole lathe for demonstrations,  but for day-to-day usage I use my Jet mini lathe, I&#039;m not getting any younger you know.  If I could lay my hands on a Barns #4 treadle lathe,  I would probably use that,  but they are very rare and Roy has two of them that I know of :)   I was great hearing from you and I encourage you to visit some the sites and read the references I have in my &quot;Links&quot; and &quot;Library links&quot;.  And as always &quot;Happy Shavings!&quot; -Aaron]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found your blog and love it I am jealous for the fact it&#039;s nice and clean as I am in my shop and still trying to build appliances and read all I can as I have cut the cord and can&#039;t be happier however I live in the wrong part of the country as in California and I can find a unicorn easier than finding reasonable priced old tools. Thanks for all the work and time of the blog. It gives me inspiration and I think I might one day have a lathe but will have to cheat somehow as I am in a wheelchair and don&#039;t think I could make a spring pole work no matter how hard I try. Thanks again would love to see your sharping station mabe I missed that part but thanks for the info! Todd]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://oldetoolworkshop.com/2012/12/13/a-bad-day/#comment-554&quot;&gt;John Brier&lt;/a&gt;.

John, thanks for the words of encouragement.  As with any labor of love it is a joy to share.   I have always liked woodworking.  As a young kid I was always building stuff.  It just took until I was much older to rediscover something that had been within me since those early years.  Hope you can pursue your interest soon.  If I had started in my late twenties,  I might be actually good by now lol.  Let me know if you want any information or advice and I will be glad to share.

					<description><![CDATA[Aaron, really cool that you are into wood working. My Dad has built countless useful things from a coat hanger to a desk to a small &quot;shack&quot; or shed which he works in and stores things. I respect the hobby greatly and hope to one day join the ranks. Also your writing is good. I enjoyed the last line in this blog. keep it up.]]></description>
