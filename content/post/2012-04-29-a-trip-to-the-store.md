One of my favorite places for purchasing old tools is located right here in central North Carolina. The store's name is "Antique Woodworking Tools" and is run by Ed Lebetkin. Ed is very knowledgeable and very friendly. He has a huge array of hand tools in stock. His store is located above Roy Underhill's Woodwright School and if you sign up to his mailing list he will send you his store schedule. So if you are ever in [Chatham County N. C.](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_County,_North_Carolina>) near Pittsboro, do yourself a favor and stop by his store and you too may leave with some new "olde" toys. Also, Ed does buy as well as sell, so if you have tools you do not need, or want to offer up for store credit, make sure you bring them along as well.
