#### We’re Sharpening Our Saws & Clearing the Bench

I am writing to let you know that **changes are coming to oldetoolworkshop.com.**

Just like a vintage hand plane that needs its sole flattened or a chisel that needs a fresh edge, sometimes a website needs a a little TLC. After years of working with Wordpress and managing a Web Server, I need to get back to the basics. My site needed a technology overhaul and so I'm biting the bullet and making the change. 

We have been working hard behind the scenes to renovate our digital workshop. Our goal is to make the site easier to navigate, faster to load, and a better resource for all things hand tools and traditional woodworking. Think of it as sweeping up the shavings and reorganizing the tool chest so we can find exactly what we need, when we need it.

### What This Means for You

Over the coming days/weeks, you might notice a few things as we transition:

* **New Layouts:** Things might move around as we find better places for them.
* **A Little Dust:** You might encounter the occasional broken link or display glitch while we glue everything back together.
* **Fresh Finish:** A new look and feel that better represents the work we do here.

### Pardon Our Sawdust

Some dusty corners of the site are getting some much needed love as such you may see the following

* Missing images
* Missing pages
* Missing past posts
* Malformed posts
* Icons going to who knows where (not dangerious, just random defaults places)
* Links that are broken


We ask for your patience and understanding during this transition. If something looks a little unfinished or a page doesn't load right away, please bear with us. We are working to get everything squared up and level as quickly as possible.

Thank you for being a part of the **Olde Tool Workshop** community. We can't wait to show you the finished project!

Let me freshin up this morning beverage and get back to the bench,
**Thank You from the Olde Tool Workshop**
