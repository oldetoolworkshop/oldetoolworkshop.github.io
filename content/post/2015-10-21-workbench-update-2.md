Yea!, My new [Benchcrafted Classic Leg Vise](<http://benchcrafted.com/ClassicLV.html>) is in. Unfortunately they must have run out of the unfinished vises, I am still very happy with this vise. The machining on their vise hardware is amazing. They are the best you can get…period!

Now to build a leg to put it in. Should be able to build a couple on Friday.
