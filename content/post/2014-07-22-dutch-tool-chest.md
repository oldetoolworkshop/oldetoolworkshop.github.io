A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the class schedule of Roy's [Woodwright's School](<http://www.woodwrightschool.com/>) and noticed Chris Schwarz from [Lost Art Press](<http://lostartpress.com/>) was going to be teaching his [Dutch Tool Chest](<http://blog.lostartpress.com/2012/12/23/lets-go-dutch-tool-chest/>). It was then I decided I would build my own Dutch Tool Chest. Yes it would have been great to take the class and experience Chris's cheeky teaching style and benefit from his vast experience, but I have a [business ](<https://www.facebook.com/hendersonshandcrafts>)to run so I can't really get away for the three day class right now. Besides, I knew I had the skills to make this simple project and decided the time was right. My old chest is great and I still use it but, It is not big enough for the tools I use everyday.

The plan was to follow the [Popular Woodworking article](<http://www.popularwoodworking.com/oct13/dutch-tool-chest>) by Chris and make the smaller, one shelf version. This small Dutch chest still holds a huge volume of tools and I will be able to work directly from it. I had most of the materials on hand and like the originals were probably built, I used what I had on hand. The sides, bottom and shelf were glued up panels of white pine and the top was a poplar panel left over from when I built a [6-Board Chest](<http://www.popularwoodworking.com/articleindex/6-board-chest>). The front and back pieces were white pine 1×12's that I was going to use on another project.

This project is very straight forward and the joinery is dead simple. Only two sets of dovetails on the bottom and the rest is screwed and/or glued. Speaking of screws, I purchased my screws and bolts from [Blacksmith Bolt & Rivet ](<http://www.blacksmithbolt.com/>). These folks are excellent and I recommend them for any hard-to-find slotted screws and old square bolts. They are quick, friendly and reasonably priced.

All said, I have about 40 hours in this chest including finishing. The most difficult part was the [breadboard ends](<http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-tips/techniques/joinery/breadboard/>) on the top as I have never done this type of top before. I must say, I love using this chest and it will be an asset in my shop and well worth the 40-hour investment in time.
