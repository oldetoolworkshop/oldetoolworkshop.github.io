![Split-Top Roubo in all it's glory](/img/2020/11/IMG_1100-copy-2-2048x1330.jpg)Kiki inspecting Roubo Workbench

This project has taken way too long to finish (my first post was on Sep. 15, 2015). This bench deserved better from me. I am on the home stretch now and only have a few tasks left. I have made a commitment to myself to finish this project before the New Year (to be exact, New Year’s Day 2021, there are some members on my family that need that specific of a date declaration.) Here is a casual non-exhaustive, non-binding list of things to finish:

o Make and install deadman   
o Level the tops, make sure they are shimmed and ready for mounting to base   
o Install barrel nuts on the top slabs  
o This is embarrassing, but put front dovetailed veneer piece to cover trim sawing disaster (more on this later)  
o Install a Roubo-style bench stop made by [Peter Ross](<https://www.peterrossblacksmith.com/>). This was a late addition after careful consideration and desire to have more work holding options  
o Pre-finish cleanup of all surfaces  
o Make a new center board as the old one was just temporary   
o Finish the bench  
o Enjoy!

All in all, not that much work remaining considering all I have put into this project. I have used and continue to use this bench. I LOVE IT! Best thing I have ever built by a long shot. My second workbench (if I build another) will not take nearly as long. 

This is one of the truly good things to come out of the Covid-19 lockdown. 

I will write a lessons learned post after I have finished the workbench. I wish I had gotten a copy of the “[Anarchists Workbench](<https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-workbench>)” (The PDF is free to download "And it’s covered by a creative commons license that allows you to use the material however you like for non-commercial purposes.") before building this bench, but I am very happy with the workbench I have built and it will serve me well for the rest of my life. One thing I do regret is buying a commercial workbench for $500. I bought that bench before I “knew better” but that is a cop out. I should have done more research, even back then before laying out that much money. Also, I had seen [Roy Underhill build his workbench](<https://www.pbs.org/video/woodwrights-shop-french-work-bench-part-1/>) on the “[Woodwright’s Shop](<https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop/>)” years before, but did not think I had the skills to build one myself. 

Never underestimate your abilities! You can do it. Yes, you will make mistakes, I made LOTS of them. 

Build  
Fail  
Try Again  
Fail  
Build Some More  
SUCCEED!

This the way.

You will figure out how to fix mistakes and you can complete the project if you stick to it. I love to work on problems, and this build gave me no shortage of them. I love to innovate and my solution for the right front bench dog ejector “[Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks](<../../../05/15/teaching-a-new-dog-old-tricks/index.html>)" was particularly satisfying. 

Here are some adjectives to describe this project in no particular order - Fun, Strenuous, Challenging, Frustrating, Satisfying, Educational, Joy, Sorrow, Ingenious.

Peace,

Aaron
