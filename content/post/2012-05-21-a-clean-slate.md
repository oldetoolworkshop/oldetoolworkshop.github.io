# A Clean Slate

[![](../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/new_shop01-209x300.jpg)](<../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/05/new_shop01.jpg>)

I finally emptied my old office this weekend. This is the space for my new "traditional" workshop. Now that it is cleared out, I am on schedule for painting the walls and installing the new flooring. If I can find a deal on some nice maple flooring, I will use that, otherwise oak is my second choice.

My next steps are:

  1. Rip out old carpet and padding
  2. Paint
  3. Prep concrete for subfloor
  4. Install vapor barrier
  5. Install subfloor (Hopefully to be completed by the end memorial day weekend)
  6. Purchase flooring
  7. After a week of acclimating, install flooring
  8. Finish floor
  9. Move in



I know this is not really a woodworking project per se, but it will allow me to be more productive and by being in the house, more inviting. I know my cat will like it. He loves to roll in wood shavings and then track them all through the house. My wife does not like this, but we tolerate it, as it is a small price to pay to have a happy cat.

My next project after getting my shop situated will be to make a "proper" workbench. This, of course, will be chronicled here for your amusement.
