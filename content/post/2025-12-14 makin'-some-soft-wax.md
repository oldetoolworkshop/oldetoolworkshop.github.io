Well, it’s that time of the year when a man’s thoughts turn to soft wax. Homemade soft wax is an indispensable component in any traditional woodworking shop. It’s safe, easy to use, and has a lot of applications from coating tools to prevent rust to using it as a milk paint top coat. 


I decided to make up a fresh batch today, as I had all the materials according to Lost Art Press’s recipe, which calls for 2 cups of boiled linseed oil, 108 g of food-grade beeswax, and 4 tablespoons of citrus solvent. I added an extra tablespoon of solvent because I wanted my wax just a little bit softer.

The great thing about making your own soft wax is that there are no harsh chemicals, and you don’t have to put on a mask or worry about ventilation when you apply it. Some commercial waxes contain metallic driers that can be harmful to your health. I highly recommend making some homemade soft wax for yourself, as it’s a great alternative to that big-box store stuff that isn’t so good for you.

Soft Wax Recipe (Fine Woodworking) – Chris Schwarz’s detailed version of the [Lost Art Press recipe.](https://www.finewoodworking.com/2025/09/25/chris-schwarzs-soft-wax-recipe "Lost Art Press recipe.")

The recipe is also included in Chris's book "American Peasant," which he provides the [downloadable PDF](https://blog.lostartpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/American-Peasant-July-2024.pdf) for free. Just search for "soft wax.” This is a wonderful book, BTW, and I suggest you buy the hard copy too to support this company that does so much for our hobby/craft/vocation!

### Getting it all together ###

It took me a minute to get all the parts together for this batch. I did some thrifting a couple of weekends ago and found a really nice small crockpot that was just the right size, but it was missing its knob. Fortunately, I know how to design parts and I have a 3D printer, so I was able to replace that knob with my own creation.

I also had to order the citrus solvent, as I didn’t have any on hand. I already had the beeswax and the boiled linseed oil.

I followed the instructions for the recipe (except, as mentioned earlier, I added a little more solvent to make a softer wax), and it came out perfect. I made the exact amount they recommended and ended up with four small glass jars. I like to use jars similar to jelly jars that take a small Mason jar lid. They’re easy to store and not too bulky.

I put the linseed oil in a large tin can and used it as a double boiler, and added the other ingredients as the recipe calls for. I also used a food thermometer to keep an eye on the oil temperature, making sure it stayed below 180°F. It mostly hovered in the 150°F–155°F range during the entire process, which worked out really well.

### Uses for soft wax ###

I use soft wax for many different things, including but not limited to coating iron and high-carbon steel tools to prevent rust, reconditioning leather sheaths and other leather items, and even treating my leather boots. It can also be used over milk paint as a finish, which is very easy to apply and nearly foolproof.

### Final Thoughts / Links ###

I want to thank Lost Art Press for this recipe and everything else they do for the craft! To sum it up, this is a fun and easy project that adds a natural finish to your process. Go ahead and make some for yourself; you’ll be glad you did.
