# Tools, Tools, Tools!

On Saturday the 15th of September, my brother, Berry, and I went to the [Mid-West Tool Collectors Association](<http://www.mwtca.org/>) annual tool meet here in Raleigh, NC. This is one of my favorite meets as it is not far from my home, the weather is usually not too hot, and there are tons of tools and experts to tell you all about them.

Here are some of the highlights of this years meet:

  * An Estate sale with a lot of different quality levels of tools and lot of bargains
  * Lots of vendors
  * A talk from a couple of members about the "Antique Roadshow" and "American Pickers"
  * Bar-B-Que otherwise know here in this area as a "Pig Pickin"
  * A tool auction



I love the excitement of the meet and how everyone loves to talk tools. I learn so much, and like to talk to the "Old Timers."

Height Adjustable Cast Iron Legs

The real action for me this year was the Estate Sale. The prices dropped throughout the day, and if your item was not snatched up before it got to your desired price, you could get some pretty good deals.

I purchased several items during the meet (I'll spare you the detailed list) but the one that has the most potential is:

A set of iron workbench legs

I know they don't look like much now, but when I get them sand-blasted, painted and installed under a marble or stone slab it will be a whole different story 🙂

Now just 362 more days (give or take) until the next meet.
