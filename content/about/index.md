# About Me

Hi, I’m Aaron, and woodworking has been my passion for over 12 years. My journey started with a fascination for creating functional pieces from raw materials and has grown into a full-fledged workshop practice where I explore both traditional and modern techniques.  

I have a deep appreciation for classic craftsmanship, and I often focus on projects that highlight traditional joinery, elegant design, and lasting functionality. Some of my favorite projects include Windsor chairs, Welsh-style stick chairs, and intricate tool chests inspired by historic Dutch designs. My Dutch tool chest project, in particular, exceeded my expectations, and I’m currently adding a lower chest with a mobile base to expand its utility.  

I enjoy working with hand tools wherever possible — from hand planes to saws — to achieve the kind of precision and tactile satisfaction that power tools can’t fully replicate. I prefer old-fashioned aesthetics, which is why I opt for slot screws over Phillips whenever possible; it’s a small detail that maintains the traditional feel of my work.  

My workshop is a space for exploration and careful refinement. I spend a lot of time on fitting joints and molding by hand, often relying on trial, error, and hand planes to get things just right. Every project is an opportunity to push my skills, whether it’s perfecting the fit of a piece of furniture or experimenting with a new technique.  

Beyond furniture, I’m also deeply interested in woodworking tools themselves — from making lock-stitching awls to designing bespoke jigs — and I love documenting these tools and processes for reference and sharing with others.  

This blog is where I share my woodworking journey: projects, techniques, design inspirations, and lessons learned along the way. I hope it serves as both a resource and an inspiration for anyone who loves creating with wood.  

Feel free to explore, ask questions, or follow along as I continue to craft, refine, and enjoy the art of woodworking.
