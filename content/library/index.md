## Library

Library  
  
Here is a list of publications that I have referenced during my formative woodworking years up to and including now. They are what I consider must reads.  
  
#### Joseph Moxon ####

* [Mechanick Exercises](http://books.google.com/books?id=t_IRCzjTf08C) – “Or, The Doctrine of Handy-works. Applied to the Arts of Smithing, Joinery, Carpentry, Turning, Bricklayery…” – 1703  
  
#### Roy Underhill’s Publications ####


* [The Woodwright’s Shop](http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=622) – Working Wood with Wedge and Edge
* [The Woodwright’s Guide](http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=1562) – A Practical Guide to Traditional Woodcraft  
  
#### Lost Art Press and Chris Schwarz’s Publications ####

(Any from LAP, but here are some I recommend)

* [Lost Art Press Books](https://lostartpress.com/collections/books) 

* [The Anarchist’s Tool Chest ](http://www.lostartpress.com/The_Anarchist_s_Tool_Chest_and_DVD_p/bk-atc-kit.htm)  2011 –  This is an well written book with all the information you need to build and stock a traditional joiners tools chest.

* [The Anarchist’s Design Book](https://lostartpress.com/collections/books/products/the-anarchists-design-book)

* [Workbenches: From Design & Theory to Construction & Use](http://books.google.com/books/about/Workbenches.html?id=zN-ZBSv2UuIC) [Handplane Essentials](https://books.google.com/books?id=QR7gAhT4WmoC)

* Any of their translations from Andre Roubo  
  
#### Jennie Alexander & Peter Follansbee ####

* [Make a Joint Stool from a Tree: An Introduction to 17th-century Joinery](http://www.lostartpress.com/Make_a_Joint_Stool_from_a_Tree_p/bk-majsfat.htm)  
  
#### Jim Tolpin ####

* [The New Traditional Woodworker](http://books.google.com/books?id=tyh0I71Yi8gC) From Tool Set to Skill Set to Mind Set  
  
#### Aldren A. Watson ####

Aldren A. Watson is an excellent illustrator and artist. These books are very well written and a big help to anyone starting out in Traditional Woodworking. They are a great reference to experienced woodworkers as well. Get any one (or all) of these books, you can thank me later. Hint: check Abe books, or other book sellers besides Amazon. They can be pretty pricey on Amazon.

* [Country Furniture](https://books.google.com/books?id=pp1TPgAACAAJ)
* [Hand Tools: Their Ways and Workings](https://books.google.com/books?id=o2mtPd4gsosC)
* [Furniture Making Plain & Simple](https://books.google.com/books?id=W2BsAAAACAAJ)
