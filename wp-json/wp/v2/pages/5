I can remember going into his shop when I was 6 or 7 and smelling the the wood and the linseed oil he used as a finish. He would always stop what he was doing and take time to show me what he was working on, no matter how busy he was .<\/p>\n<p>Years later, along comes, Roy Underhill, of the long running\u00a0PBS show <a title=\"Woodwright's Shop\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/show\/woodwrights-shop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Woodwright&#8217;s Shop<\/a> filmed in nearby Chapel Hill, NC. He \u00a0has had a big\u00a0influence on me and how I approach this wonderful craft. \u00a0I have watched his show since it&#8217;s\u00a0\u00a0start with awe and fascination. I finally got a chance to meet Roy when I took his dovetail class in May 2012. I was hooked on hand tools and have never looked back. \u00a0Others have influenced\u00a0me as well, such as Chris Schwarz of <a href=\"http:\/\/lostartpress.com\">Lost Art Press<\/a> and previous Editor of Popular Woodworking, and Bill Anderson of The <a title=\"Woodwright's School\" href=\"http:\/\/www.woodwrightschool.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Woodwright&#8217;s School<\/a> and <a title=\"Edward's Mountain Woodworks\" href=\"http:\/\/www.edwardsmountainwoodworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Edward&#8217;s\u00a0 Mountain Woodworks<\/a> and many others.<\/p>\n<p>My goal\u00a0for the site and blog is to document and capture my journey in\u00a0woodworking and maybe help other people from my triumphs and mistakes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Aaron Henderson and I love old tools.\u00a0 I use old tools to do traditional woodworking, as well as new tools based on old designs, and I also compliment my collection with tools that I\u00a0make myself.\u00a0 I have been involved in woodworking in varying degrees for\u00a040 years, but it has only been in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":5,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-5","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/P5zOwr-5","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5"}],"version-history":[{"count":18,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4011,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5\/revisions\/4011"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
