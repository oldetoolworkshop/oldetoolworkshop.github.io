I decided to build two end tables so that I could maximize my wood use and match the pair using the same wood for the whole project.<\/p>\n<p>My first step was to procure a beautiful piece of cherry from the local lumber yard, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.capitolcitylumber.com\/\">Capital City Lumber,<\/a> here in Raleigh.\u00a0 I did score a choice board\u00a0 8\/4&#8243;x12&#8243;x8&#8242;.\u00a0 This was a thing of beauty and I have to give credit to my friend, Bob, who saw this board and called it to my attention.<\/p>\n<p>The next step after getting it home was board layout. In order to get the most use out of a board and avoid waste, it is important to plan the usage of each section of a board and how to cut it out .\u00a0 I worked this around in my head for a couple of days to avoid making a mistake on this expensive and precious lumber.\u00a0 This is part of any woodworking project takes time to learn and gain experience.\u00a0 Fortunately I have been doing board layout for some time now, so I felt confident in my layout decisions.\u00a0 I have done numerous projects with less expensive lumber that have really added to my knowledge and skill level.<\/p>\n<p>One of the big challenges for this project is the stock thickness. It is 8\/4 or roughly 2&#8243; thick.\u00a0 Most of the boards called for in this project (except the legs) are 3\/4&#8243;.\u00a0 In a conventional shop you would &#8220;re-saw&#8221; these pieces in half on a band saw and have two pieces about 7\/8&#8243; thick. My band saw is currently down for repairs so I have to do it the old fashion way, with a rip saw.\u00a0 That&#8217;s right the following will have to be cut in this manner:\u00a0 2 tops 9&#215;18, 2 drawer fronts 4&#215;12 and 6 aprons or stretchers 5 1\/2&#215;13.\u00a0 I have about 2 full days of sawing ahead of me, but it will be worth it. Below is a picture of my rough sawn stock cut to the length and width.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Rough-Stock-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-855 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Rough-Stock-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Rough Stock\" width=\"625\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Rough-Stock-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Rough-Stock-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Rough-Stock-1-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an effort to expand my experience with building larger woodworking projects, I am starting this new year making some furniture pieces.\u00a0 I do not want to go totally crazy, so I am starting on two Shaker end tables featured in the September 2004 Issue of Woodworking Magazine.\u00a0 This article goes into great detail on [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[34],"tags":[37,36,35],"class_list":["post-853","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-furniture","tag-cherry","tag-end-table","tag-shaker"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p5zOwr-dL","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/853","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=853"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/853\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":858,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/853\/revisions\/858"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=853"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=853"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=853"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
