The first and second coats do not usually look very good, but the third and fourth are really nice. This piece was an exception, It took the milk paint like it had been waiting for it. This piece has been an absolute pleasure to paint! New wood sometimes resists milk paint especially if it still has some moisture in it, but this cabinet is very dry and been really fun to paint.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>After I finish the painting, I will take some brown grocery bag and crumple it up and really give it a good buffing. this will burnish the surface and get it ready for the paste wax top coat.<\/p>\n<p>Check back tomorrow to see how it turned out \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1248\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1248\" class=\"wp-image-1248 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shop-Cat-Supervision-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shop-Cat-Supervision-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shop-Cat-Supervision-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shop-Cat-Supervision-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shop-Cat-Supervision-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shop-Cat-Supervision-624x624.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1248\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shop Cat helping paint dry<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Happy Shavings&#8221;<br \/>\n-Aaron<\/p>\n<p>P.S.
