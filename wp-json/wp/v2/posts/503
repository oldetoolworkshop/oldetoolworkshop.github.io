\u00a0I decided to do both. \u00a0First, I saw cut a tangent that intersected both high points. \u00a0Then, I cut out a &#8220;V&#8221; in the valley of the ogee curve. \u00a0This got me close enough to use the chisel to chop away even more; being careful not to go too deep, and always chiseling downhill to the grain. \u00a0Then, I followed the chiseling with my rasps; first the course rasp to remove the most material, and then, the fine rasp to clean up after the coarse. \u00a0This left a really nice finish, and will require only minor sanding.<\/p>\n<p>I repeated the same process for the tall side, and then it was time to put the ogees on the shoulders and cut out the upper portion on the tall side. \u00a0I used a compass to draw 1\/2&#8243; arcs of the small ogees on the shoulders, and for the top of the short side, I used 3\/4&#8243; arcs. \u00a0I then marked out the taper on the upper portion, and cut both sides with my rip saw.<\/p>\n<p>Next, came the two bed rails and the the bottom stretcher. \u00a0I trued them up and cut all three pieces to the the same length. \u00a0I then aligned all ends, and marked them all at the same time for the tenon locations, with a framing square. \u00a0This ensured consistent spacing on all three tenons, and the uprights are parallel. \u00a0I\u00a0cut out the tenons on the bed rails, and the stretcher rail, and then started on the mortises.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_506\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/spring_pole_lathe_1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-506\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-506\" alt=\"Side view getting an idea of the bed rail fit\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/spring_pole_lathe_1-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/spring_pole_lathe_1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/spring_pole_lathe_1-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-506\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Side view getting an idea of the bed rail fit<\/p><\/div>\n<p>For the bed rails, it is important to have them planed to the same height. \u00a0The bed rails have to be level to allow the tail stock to slide freely and not bind. \u00a0Likewise, the inside faces need to be planed flat to each other.<\/p>\n<p>Before putting the mortises in, I trued the uprights. \u00a0After cleaning and ensuring both upright-end&#8217;s mortise and tenons were tuned, and a good fit to the feet, I used a block plane to shave off the high-side foot, until the upright showed level and square to the floor.<\/p>\n<p>To mark the mortise locations, I used a 3&#8243; spacer between the bed rails, and clamped a support stick on the upright to support the rails while they were being marked on the uprights. \u00a0I was very careful in setting this up as to ensure the bed would be level, and consistent, in width along its length. \u00a0I really took my time to ensure this step was done precisely.<\/p>\n<p>Round or square wedges?
