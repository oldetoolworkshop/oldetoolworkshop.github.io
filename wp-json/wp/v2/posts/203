It is not the problem. \u00a0I also have a 90&#8217;s version of the Veritas marking gauge from Lee Valley tools[1].\u00a0 This is a nice gauge also, and I have used it for years without a problem; however, after seeing how useful it was to fully retract the blade into the body of the Tite-Mark gauge, I came up with what seemed to be, a brilliant idea: \u00a0I would drill out the body of the Veritas so I could fully retract the cutter in it.\u00a0 It is brass and easy to work &#8230; right?<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0 proceeded to secure this gauge in my wood clamp and started drilling away.\u00a0 So far so good. \u00a0I was making good headway, and then disaster.\u00a0 The body fell away, leaving only the face of the tool in the clamp.\u00a0 Apparently,\u00a0 this was NOT one solid piece of brass. It is made of a solid brass faceplate, with a cylinder turned on it that is inserted into the mystery metal body.\u00a0 Now I only have one functional gauge again.\u00a0 Oh the sadness,\u00a0 I now have a base comprised of two pieces where there was once one.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge_base.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-209\" title=\"Veritas Gauge Base\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge_base-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge_base-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge_base.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_208\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-208\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-208\" title=\"Veritas Gauge\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/veritas_gauge.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-208\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Actually three pieces, but the base should be one<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Determined to fix this, I planned to finish drilling into the black base about 2mm further, drill and tap 2 screws through the faceplate and into the base, and secure with two brass metal screws. \u00a0This should be sufficient to rejoin the two parts and I will have achieved my initial goal, albeit with a little extra work.<\/p>\n<p>My plan was to drill screw holes and tap them to fix the faceplate to the base. \u00a0After careful examination, I noticed the base was not very thick and the screws would not be very deep, and therefore weaker.\u00a0 What I decided to do, was finish drilling down to the needed depth in the base, and then glue the faceplate to the base after I finished.<\/p>\n<p>Things never go as planned. \u00a0As I started drilling, the remainder of the brass tube came out and got stuck on the drill bit.\u00a0 After extricating the small brass ring from the drill bit, I noticed a small rubber grommet coming out of the hole.\u00a0 This grommet provides friction for the rod and helps set the depth more accurately, so I had to make sure to get this grommet fixed back into place.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to file this small ring flat on the drilled side and slide it back into place to hold the rubber grommet in place. After mixing up some epoxy, I glued the faceplate back on the base and now it is a fully functioning gauge with a retractable cutter.\u00a0 Yea!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_standing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-213\" title=\"fixed_gauge_standing\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_standing-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_standing-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_standing.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_face.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-214\" title=\"fixed_gauge_face\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_face-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_face-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/fixed_gauge_face.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>[1] The current <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leevalley.com\/us\/wood\/page.aspx?p=59455&amp;cat=1,42936\">Veritas gauges<\/a> now have the retractable cutter.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; It all started when I followed Chris Schwarz&#8217;s advice and bought the Glen-Drake Tite-Mark marking gauge.
