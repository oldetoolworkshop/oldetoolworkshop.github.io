after which, you have something new that you made, and can be proud of. \u00a0After my previous weekend escapade (see <a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/?p=350\">A Bad Day<\/a> post), I was in the need of some serious fun. \u00a0The chance came in the form of a class at Roy Underhill&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodwrightschool.com\">Woodwright&#8217;s School<\/a>. \u00a0I was scheduled for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodwrightschool.com\/moravian-workbench\/\">Mystery Mallet<\/a>\u00a0class on Saturday. \u00a0This is a whole day class where you make an intriguing and beautiful woodworking puzzle. \u00a0The class fit the bill perfectly to balance the experiences of the previous weekend.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever I take classes at the Woodwright&#8217;s School, the time passes so quickly. \u00a0I guess that is a good indication that I am having a good time. \u00a0My neighbor, Bob, and I signed up together for this class. \u00a0I always enjoy taking classes with Bob as he provides both humor and frankness to any situation.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_380\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Bob.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-380\" class=\" wp-image-380 \" title=\"Bob\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Bob.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Bob.jpg 640w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Bob-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My neighbor Bob listening intently<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Roy really does a great job of teaching and making you feel at ease. \u00a0He is very supportive, and I always learn some new technique or tip to help me improve my skills. \u00a0I was a little nervous about taking this class as it does require some precision cuts, and as I mentioned in my last blog, \u00a0sawing is one of the areas where I need more experience. \u00a0It turned out that my nervousness was unfounded, as Roy showed us some techniques that help keep your cuts clean and straight.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_379\" style=\"width: 627px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-379\" class=\"size-full wp-image-379\" title=\"Roy_teaches\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Roy_teaches.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Roy_teaches.jpg 617w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Roy_teaches-289x300.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-379\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Roy attempting to teach me how to saw<\/p><\/div>\n<p>For the most part, the day went very smooth. \u00a0I was pleased to see that I was able to do all the cuts very accurately, and I did one the best mortices I have ever carved. \u00a0This really gave me a lot of confidence for what was to come. \u00a0I was also pleased with the pace of my progress; I was keeping up with the class. \u00a0You see, I like to take my time in woodworking, so sometimes I lag the class.<\/p>\n<p>At lunchtime, we ate at the S&amp;T Soda Shoppe (they make the best milkshakes in the world). \u00a0This is always a great way to slow down and discuss the class and other topics with Roy and to get to know your classmates. \u00a0 I also saw Will Myers there; he is the instructor for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodwrightschool.com\/moravian-workbench\/\">Moravian Workbench class<\/a>\u00a0that I am scheduled to take in June. \u00a0I had met Will in a previous saw sharpening class taught by Bill Anderson.<\/p>\n<p>After lunch, I went to Ed Lebetkin&#8217;s tool store. \u00a0Boy, this place is wonderful, but care must be taken to not empty my bank account. \u00a0My wife, Beth, is pretty understanding, and knows when I go there I usually buy a tool&#8230;.or five. \u00a0This time, I only bought a 24&#8243; folding rule and a #12 hollow moulding plane. \u00a0This was money well spent as I needed both of these items. \u00a0The #12 plane was a match to my #12 round moulding plane that I already own. \u00a0Fortunately, I was through with my purchases when I heard Roy hitting the ceiling with a board, announcing class was commencing. \u00a0I hurried downstairs to the classroom, not wanting to miss one minute of class time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_382\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Sepia_me.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-382\" class=\"size-full wp-image-382\" title=\"Sepia_me\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Sepia_me.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Sepia_me.jpg 640w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/Sepia_me-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-382\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I saw the way<\/p><\/div>\n<p>I did not mention it before, but there is some risk involved with this project; it can just &#8220;explode&#8221; during final assembly. \u00a0I know it sounds a bit dramatic, but that is exactly what happens sometimes when assembling these mallets.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the classroom, the class proceed as scheduled until Roy stopped the class to assemble a student&#8217;s mallet. \u00a0The whole class held its breath as Roy and the student drove the handle into the mallet head. \u00a0They finished, and the handle bottomed out; now the moment of truth: \u00a0Time to release the vice holding the mallet head. \u00a0If everything is good, there will be silence; if not, there will be a &#8220;CRACK!&#8221; \u00a0Fortunately for the student it did not crack and it looked good.<\/p>\n<p>I finished mine next. \u00a0I followed Roy&#8217;s advice and made all the necessary adjustments to the handle. \u00a0I fit it in the top as a test and everything looked good and not a bit tight. \u00a0Roy asked me if I wanted to proceed and I said &#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221; and then he said &#8220;You know it could go very wrong,&#8221; and I said &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this&#8221; and he said &#8220;OK&#8230;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We started hammering away at this thing and it was slowly proceeding, moving very little with each mallet blow. \u00a0Roy stopped for a second since we had stopped progressing and decided to get out the Big Mall. \u00a0We proceeded to hammer away at it until it bottomed out. \u00a0Then we removed it from the vice and found that there was a section that had caught and split off. \u00a0Roy knocked it back in place and pronounced it done. \u00a0Not planning to actually use this mallet for wood working, it looked pretty good with only a small crack where it had split. \u00a0Roy said with some block planing and a little wax (a lot as it turned out), it would look great.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_381\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/beknighted.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-381\" class=\" wp-image-381  \" title=\"beknighted\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/beknighted.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/beknighted.jpg 640w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/beknighted-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-381\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Roy be-knighting me<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The rest of the class finished up in short order;
