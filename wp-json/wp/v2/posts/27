making this blog entry today.\u00a0 She has given me the inspiration, the time and most of all the encouragement to pursue my passion for woodworking.\u00a0 She has agreed to let me move my workshop from my garage to our office inside the house.\u00a0 This new location has a lot of advantages over my current setup.<\/p>\n<p>First, it has natural light provided by two large east-facing windows, not southern as the optimum, but a great improvement over my florescent light I use in my current garage workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it will be a more comfortable location because my garage is not heated or cooled.\u00a0 The lack of heating is not as big of\u00a0 an advantage as the cooling,\u00a0 the summers here in North Carolina are hot and humid and that is a very challenging environment for hand woodworking.<\/p>\n<p>Third,\u00a0 it is a clean slate and I can design the new space specifically to meet my woodworking needs.\u00a0 My current space is pretty much a random grouping of items I have thrown together to make a workshop.\u00a0 I have learned a bit about how I work and where I like to position my tools and furnishings for optimal efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>The last advantage is that I am planning to install a hardwood floor to help my back while spending joyful hours standing at my workbench.<\/p>\n<p>Come on and join me in this new adventure and watch my new space take shape.\u00a0 Well,\u00a0 I better get started, there&#8217;s no time like the present \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Aaron<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My wife is awesome!\u00a0 She is
