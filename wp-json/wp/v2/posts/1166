First and foremost, it would solve my clamping issue as 2x4s are cheap and would be sufficient for the task. Second, it will help straighten the bow out of my boards as gravity will do most of the work. Also, as a side benefit the\u00a0top will be mostly flattened up against the upright boards called &#8220;twins&#8221; (some flattening work is always needed after glue-up).<\/p>\n<p>I need to slightly modify the design to accommodate the wider face of the boards, so I would need to make wider wedges\u00a0to ensure pressure is applied to the full width of the boards being clamped. The benchtops I am gluing up are only 11 inches in width so the twins do not need to be very long, in my case I am using 24 inch long boards. I am also going to apply paste wax to the twins inner surface to keep the glue squeeze out from sticking to them.<\/p>\n<p>Below\u00a0is my test setup with some narrower wedges, but sighting down the boards, they look very straight and no bow at all. I have looked for examples of this procedure for face gluing boards and I could not find any.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/IMG_5951-e1513689196463.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1168\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/IMG_5951-e1513689196463-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5951\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/IMG_5951-e1513689196463-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/IMG_5951-e1513689196463-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/IMG_5951-e1513689196463-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/IMG_5951-e1513689196463-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Andre Roubo and Lost Art Press, I am back in the workbench building business and hopefully in a couple of weeks I will have a fully functional and beautiful workbench (not like the pathetic one seen in the background).<\/p>\n<p>Peace,<br \/>\n-Aaron<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know the the saying, &#8220;Everything old is new again?&#8221; As you may or may not know, I have been in the process of building my workbench for over a year now and I have been struggling with the benchtop glue-up as I have fewer clamps than I would like and my boards for the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[42],"tags":[45,43,44],"class_list":["post-1166","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-workbench","tag-andre-roubo","tag-roubo","tag-workbench"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p5zOwr-iO","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1166","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1166"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1166\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1175,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1166\/revisions\/1175"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1166"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1166"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1166"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
