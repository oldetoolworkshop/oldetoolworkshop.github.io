Then drill a 1\/4&#8243; hole in the top end of the shaft for the strapping. \u00a0I also, very carefully, drilled a 1\/4&#8243; hole in center of the tip of shaft.<\/p>\n<p>3) Make the pump stick.\u00a0 Drill a 7\/8&#8243; hole in the center of my walnut scrap that was about 18&#8243;X2&#8243;X7\/8&#8243;.\u00a0 Then drill a 1\/4&#8243; hole for the strapping in each end about 3\/4&#8243; from the ends.\u00a0 To finish I tapered the ends on the shaving horse with my draw knife and spokeshave and beveled the sharp edges with my new LN block plane.<\/p>\n<p>Assembly<\/p>\n<p>This could not be easier, I added some bees wax to the shaft where the pump stick would be sliding up and down.\u00a0 Then slide the pump stick on the shaft and then attach the leather strapping thru the hole in the tip and secure with a small wedge.\u00a0 Next pass the strap through the top hole in the shaft and then back to the other end of the pump stick and secure in the same manner as the other side.\u00a0 You should adjust the pump stick to hang about 1&#8243; &#8211; 1 1\/2&#8243; from touching the flywheel.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/IMG_0724.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-480\" alt=\"IMG_0724\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/IMG_0724-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/IMG_0724-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/IMG_0724-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the video below, you will see that for demonstration purposes, I added one of my spring pole lathe centers to the tip on the shaft so that it would spin when I pumped it.\u00a0 I did make a trip to ED Lebetkin&#8217;s awesome tool store and purchased two drill &#8220;spoon&#8221; type bits that work really well in these types of drills.\u00a0 Ordinary twist bits will only cut on half of the strokes and are not very efficient.\u00a0 These spoon bits cut on every stroke as they have a cutting edge on each side.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center;
