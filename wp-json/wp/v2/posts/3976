Mallets and Hammers offer the woodworker a great opportunity to make their own tools. At least this was the case for me. I have made several striking tools and I love using them. Woodworking mallets are simple to make and can last you a lifetime (more on that later). Good hammers are easy to re-handle and a joy to use. I have just a drop in the bucket of types of striking tools available to the modern craftsman, but every one of them gets plenty of use.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:18% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"190\" height=\"504\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nail.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4016 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nail.png 190w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nail-113x300.png 113w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nail-57x150.png 57w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The nail on the magnet pictured on the left, is a nail I found at the homestead of my 5th Great-Grandfather.

I&#8217;ve seen people with dozens of hammers, but I prefer to keep only the ones I need and will use regularly.  My Vaughan 16 OZ Octagon Hammer is very nice. I bought it in 2012 from a local hardware store but it had a &#8220;singing&#8221; problem. Some hammers made with hardened steel sing or ring when struck. Some folks just accept it and others like me find it a bit annoying. I&#8217;ve looked for a solution for a while but I finally thought of a fix. Because it&#8217;s the claw that &#8220;sings&#8221;, I thought maybe some CA glue at the apex of the claw would dampen it.  Sure enough it did, by about 70%. I can live with the reduced volume and it&#8217;s no longer a concern. I&#8217;m hoping the glue will not break off after lots of use, I&#8217;ll let you know it it does, but for right now I enjoying the softer songs it produces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> The 7 oz. Homemade Brass hammer (Jan 2015) was a really great addition to my hammer set. I blogged about it <a href=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2015\/01\/18\/brass-hammer\/\">here<\/a> and I have used it as my primary plane iron adjuster. It&#8217;s also used any time I don&#8217;t want the mar the surface of metal object I&#8217;m striking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Vaughan DO16 16 OZ Modified Octagon Nail Hammer<\/li><li>Workforce 7 oz. with Hickory Handle<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lie-nielsen.com\/products\/cross-peen-hammer-A2\">Lie-Nielsen 4 oz.

But I will concentrate on just the few types I own. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made my first mallets in 2010 from hard maple I bought from the lumber yard. The first was a small mallet like the one pictured above, made from an article in an old wood-working magazine. I laminated the head from three pieces of the maple. I was using this first mallet in my first class at the Woodwright&#8217;s School making dovetails. While I was chopping out some wood the head exploded into 3 different parts (my understanding of gluing was still in it&#8217;s early stages). I embarrassingly looked around me to see if anyone noticed the mishap (I was at the rear most bench) and thankfully no one did. Only the handle survived.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was about this time that I was able to get a stump from a maple that my Dad had cut down on the property where I grew up. I shaped this head and put in on the surviving handle and it has served me well ever since. I made a second small mallet just like the first except I used a solid piece of hickory rescued from my wife Beth&#8217;s childhood home. The hickory used to host a tree-swing in her childhood and gave her many happy memories, but the tree was toppled by a storm. I liked this mallet a little better as the Hickory was tough as nails and weighted more than the Soft Maple version. We have since started using the first mallet in our kitchen for pounding chicken breasts flat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second mallet I made was made at the same time and manner as the first &#8220;exploding&#8221; mallet and it is used for my heaviest tasks. It works great and time will tell if it has the same fate as the first. It has lasted 10 years, so I think I&#8217;m good. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third mallet is a Estwing 12 oz. Soft Face Mallet. I use this as a &#8220;dead blow&#8221; mallet even if it&#8217;s not really one. I like its weight and it does the job I need done. Granted I haven&#8217;t done any really &#8220;big&#8221; jobs that need that kind of persuading (except the <a href=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/category\/workbench\/\">Split-top Roubo Workbench<\/a>), so I may have to resort to an actual dead blow mallet in that instance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, I have a Lathe Maple Mallet I use to pound mercilessly on my lathe center to set it into a turned piece.  The mallet &#8220;takes a hit for the team&#8221; and gets damaged on every use to spare my center from being damaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Small Soft Maple Head Mallet<\/span> (replacement for the exploded mallet)<\/li><li>Small Hickory Head Mallet<\/li><li>Large Maple Mallet<\/li><li>Estwing 12 oz.
