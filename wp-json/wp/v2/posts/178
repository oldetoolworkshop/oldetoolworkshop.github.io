a Martha Stewart color from Home Depot in Behr single coat paint, which really lives up to its description; it only took one gallon to paint my whole workshop.\u00a0 The paint has light green and yellow tints, and changes color throughout the day.\u00a0 This will go well with the white oak flooring and my darker green tool chest, and keep the space a warm, welcoming and wonderful environment to hone my craft.<\/p>\n<p>I also finished installing my new light fixture, but I will show this when I complete the space since there&#8217;s a good story to go with it&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I moved the flooring into the workshop to acclimate to the conditions in the house.\u00a0 I needed to get this done by Sunday because I had a medical procedure scheduled on Monday, so the wood will acclimate while I heal.\u00a0 The wood and I should be good to go at about the same time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/floor_transition.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-183\" title=\"floor_transition\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/floor_transition-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/floor_transition-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/floor_transition.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The above picture shows the transition from my existing floor to the workshop floor level.\u00a0 This will keep the overall 1 1\/2&#8243;
