It was then I decided I would build my own Dutch Tool Chest.\u00a0 Yes it would have been great to take the class and experience Chris&#8217;s cheeky teaching style and benefit from his vast experience, but I have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hendersonshandcrafts\">business <\/a>to run so I can&#8217;t really get away for the three day class right now.\u00a0 Besides, I knew I had the skills to make this simple project and decided the time was right.\u00a0 My old chest is great and I still use it but,\u00a0 It is not big enough for the tools I use everyday.<\/p>\n<p>The plan was to follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.popularwoodworking.com\/oct13\/dutch-tool-chest\">Popular Woodworking article<\/a> by Chris and make the smaller, one shelf version.\u00a0 This small Dutch chest still holds a huge volume of tools and I will be able to work directly from it.\u00a0 I had most of the materials on hand and like the originals\u00a0 were probably built, I used what I had on hand.\u00a0 The sides, bottom and shelf were glued up panels of white pine and the top was a poplar panel left over from when I built a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.popularwoodworking.com\/articleindex\/6-board-chest\">6-Board Chest<\/a>. The front and back pieces were white pine 1&#215;12&#8217;s that I was going to use on another project.<\/p>\n<p>This project is very straight forward and the joinery is dead simple.\u00a0 Only two sets of dovetails on the bottom and the rest is screwed and\/or glued. Speaking of screws, I purchased my screws and bolts from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blacksmithbolt.com\/\">Blacksmith Bolt &amp; Rivet <\/a>.\u00a0 These folks are excellent and I recommend them for any hard-to-find slotted screws and old square bolts.\u00a0 They are quick, friendly and reasonably priced.<\/p>\n<p>All said, I have about 40 hours in this chest including finishing.\u00a0 The most difficult part was the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodmagazine.com\/woodworking-tips\/techniques\/joinery\/breadboard\/\">breadboard ends<\/a> on the top as I have never done this type of top before. I must say, I love using this chest and it will be an asset in my shop and well worth the 40-hour investment in time.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n<p>Below are a few pictures of the chest.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text\/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t<\/style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-636 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest1.jpeg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest1-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest2.jpeg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest2-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest4.jpeg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest4-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest3.jpg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest3-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest6.jpeg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest6-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest5.jpeg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest5-150x150.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-642\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest5-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest5-300x298.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest5-1024x1018.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Dutch_Chest5.jpeg 1224w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-642'>\n\t\t\t\tDutch Tool Chest\n\t\t\t\t<\/dd><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the class schedule of Roy&#8217;s Woodwright&#8217;s School and noticed Chris Schwarz from Lost Art Press was going to be teaching his Dutch Tool Chest.
