well this is true for my woodworking projects as well.\u00a0 Last month I attended the MWTCA tool meet in Hillsborough, NC and I purchased a old loom shuttle for $5.00.\u00a0 If you are not familiar with loom shuttles, they are used to pass the horizontal thread through the vertical threads and they have steel cone shaped points in each end.\u00a0 It is these points that I am interested in as centers for my upcoming project &#8211; a Spring Pole Lathe.\u00a0 These points make excellent dead centers as they are perfectly round and smooth.\u00a0 I did not mind destroying this particular shuttle because it was made out of some sort a laminate and was not very old.\u00a0 I would have had a much harder time bringing my self to destroy a wooden antique, even for a good purpose.\u00a0 One other plus, I was able to re-purpose the spool in the shuttle as a leather burnisher. \u00a0It works great for this task.<\/p>\n<p>What is a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/woodwrightsshop\/how-to\/tool-chest\/lathe-spring-pole\/\">Spring Pole Lathe<\/a>&#8221; you might ask.\u00a0 A lathe is a machine used to turn round objects like spools, spindles, bowls and tool handles.\u00a0 A Spring Pole Lathe is a more traditional type of lathe that has been around for 1000&#8217;s of years.\u00a0 This is a reciprocal, driven by a cord wrapped around the piece being turned, and only cuts on the down-stroke of the foot treadle.\u00a0 There is more information at the end of this article about this amazing tool.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle-loom.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-428\" title=\"shuttle-loom\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle-loom-300x196.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle-loom-300x196.gif 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle-loom.gif 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle_tips.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-429\" title=\"shuttle_tips\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle_tips-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle_tips-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/shuttle_tips-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Back to the shuttle points.\u00a0 Well, saying that they were smooth is stretching it a little; they had a very light coat of rust.\u00a0 Fortunately, they have a nice 3\/8&#8243; shaft and mount in a drill chuck perfectly.\u00a0 A few minutes with course to finer sandpaper and they will have a nice smooth finish.\u00a0 I hope to provide each step in the lathe building process in as much detail as possible to show how this is built.<\/p>\n<p>I will be using Roy Underhill&#8217;s plans for a breakdown model for easier transport.\u00a0 I have been planning to build this for some time and I have just finished a lengthy house project and I have promised myself that the lathe is my next major woodworking project.\u00a0 I know Roy is tired of me asking tons of questions about the design.\u00a0 I just want to have a usable tool that I will get many years usage out of.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the online information and some pictures of the lathe.\u00a0 The Woodwright&#8217;s School has a class on making the lathe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodwrightschool.com\/make-the-spring-pole-lathe-w-r\/\">Making the German Spring Pole Lathe with Roy Underhill<\/a>. \u00a0 I have enough experience now that I should be able to make this myself without the class.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Woodwright's School Spring Pole Lathe class\" src=\"http:\/\/www.woodwrightschool.com\/storage\/Lathe-Class.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"247\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodturnersofthevirginias.org\/wova_documents\/treadle_lathe\/spring_pole_lathe.gif\">Here is a link to the Wood Turners of Virginia&#8217;s web site<\/a>.
