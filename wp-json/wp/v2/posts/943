I&#8217;ve been working with my lightweight commercial\u00a0workbench for way too many years. Last Friday I purchased 10 beautiful 5\/4 x 5&#8243; x 12&#8242; boards of southern yellow Pine. I had already purchased my <a href=\"http:\/\/benchcrafted.com\">Benchcrafted<\/a>\u00a0tail vice about a year and a half ago. This tail vise is\u00a0quite an expensive piece of machinery to have just laying around not earning it&#8217;s keep. So I have decided to go ahead and build my very own <a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/e\/e2\/Andr\u00e9_Jacob_Roubo_Workbench.jpg\">Roubo Workbench<\/a>. \u00a0In these pictures you&#8217;ll see the boards have already been cut in half and resting nicely on my two saw benches. I will be\u00a0following <a href=\"http:\/\/lostartpress.com\/collections\/books\/products\/workbenches-from-design-theory-to-construction-use-revised-edition\">Chris Schwarz&#8217;s\u00a0\u00a0plans<\/a> for a\u00a018th century Roubo workbench, modified as to fit incorporate my\u00a0Benchcrafted tail vise. The finished Bench top should be 5&#8243; thick, 20&#8243; wide and 72&#8243; long. \u00a0This is going to be one heavy workbench. \u00a0The overall workbench dimensions will be H 34&#8243; x W 20&#8243; X L 72&#8243;. \u00a0I am using Chris Schwarz&#8217;s book &#8220;Workbenches &#8211; From Design &amp; Theory to Construction &amp; Use&#8221; as my primary source for plans and instructions. \u00a0I also have Chris&#8217;s other workbench book &#8220;The Workbench Design Book &#8211; The Art and Philosophy of Building Better Benches&#8221;. \u00a0He has republished his &#8220;Workbenches&#8221; book and it is available on his website at <a href=\"http:\/\/lostartpress.com\">Lost Art Press<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-medium wp-image-945 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2780-e1443494365986-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2780\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2780-e1443494365986-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2780-e1443494365986-113x150.jpg 113w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2780-e1443494365986-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2780-e1443494365986-624x832.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My biggest conundrum at this point this how to mount the Benchcrafted tail vise. \u00a0The issue at hand is, I have not glued up all my boards yet because I want to cut them out before laminating them so that I don&#8217;t have to hog out a lot of material later. It&#8217;s kind of like putting a\u00a0jigsaw puzzle\u00a0together in 3-D before you&#8217;ve even seeing the pieces. Not only that, the pieces don&#8217;t exist yet, and I will have to fabricate\u00a0them correctly, so when it does go together, everything will fit perfectly.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of\u00a0making a 1\/2 scale model, just so I know how everything will fit together. This is one of those projects I have to sleep on and think about for a few days before the solution comes to me. In the meanwhile I&#8217;m studying the plans, and I&#8217;m looking at my boards in the garage longing to have this bench finished.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is what the tail vise will\u00a0look like when it is installed.<a href=\"http:\/\/benchcrafted.com\/TailVise.html\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" size-full wp-image-949 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/TailVise_250px.jpg\" alt=\"TailVise_250px\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/TailVise_250px.jpg 250w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/TailVise_250px-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/benchcrafted.com\/TailVise.html\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-948\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Tail-Vise-300x281.jpg\" alt=\"Tail-Vise\" width=\"271\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Tail-Vise-300x281.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Tail-Vise-150x140.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Tail-Vise.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This will not be a very long journey, I want this workbench finished before the ghouls and goblins come out on Halloween.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; This is a project that is way overdue.
