The nippers I acquired, upon the recommendation of the ATC tool list, worked very well to remove them. \u00a0I straightened the bent nails and used them again for the new bottom board. \u00a0This is in keeping with tradition where nails were so valuable that they were often recycled.<\/p>\n<p>In my previous post I showed pictures of the till before it was completely cut out. \u00a0I have now cut it out and it fits nicely in the dados I have put in the side boards before the assembly.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some pics of the Saw Box at this stage.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text\/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t<\/style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-304 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2012\/10\/13\/tills-and-bottoms\/box_glueup\/'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/box_glueup-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2012\/10\/13\/tills-and-bottoms\/box_empty_no_till\/'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/box_empty_no_till-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2012\/10\/13\/tills-and-bottoms\/box_empty1\/'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/box_empty1-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2012\/10\/13\/tills-and-bottoms\/box_empty2\/'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/box_empty2-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2012\/10\/13\/tills-and-bottoms\/box_full1\/'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/box_full1-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/2012\/10\/13\/tills-and-bottoms\/box_full2\/'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/box_full2-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This was a very productive week with my Saw Box. \u00a0I finished the main carcass of the box;
