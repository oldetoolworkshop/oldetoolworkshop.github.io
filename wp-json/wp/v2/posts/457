for this project.\u00a0 Much to my dismay, they do not carry dimensional SYP.\u00a0 I could not believe it, then I remembered I bought some SYP at my local Home Depot for our raised bed garden last year.\u00a0 Armed with this information I headed straight for the nearest Home Depot.<\/p>\n<p>If you have never purchased or worked with SYP, then let me tell you, it is heavy stuff!\u00a0 I remember the 2x10x12s I bought last year were really heavy.\u00a0 This time I was buying 2x12x12s and they are almost too heavy for me.\u00a0 I had a lot of difficulty choosing boards because they were so heavy and the selection was less than desirable.\u00a0 I settled on two boards and used the cut list I had prepared to have them cut the boards to a more manageable size.\u00a0 I loaded up the boards and headed home.<\/p>\n<p>Once home, I had some additional cutting to do on the table saw.\u00a0 I know, I know what you are saying:\u00a0 &#8220;You used a power tool?&#8221;\u00a0 But 24+ feet of ripping 2x stock is not what I consider fun.\u00a0 Please remember even the olde timers had access to sawmills and were able to buy pre-dressed stock.\u00a0 This is just a modern sawmill.<\/p>\n<p>After I had rough cut all my stock to length and width, I created a lettered parts list and a cut diagram from the drawings.\u00a0 Next it was time to surface plane.\u00a0 When I said that this lumber was less than desirable I mean, among other things this lumber was dirty.\u00a0 I do not have a thickness planer so I hand-surfaced the stock with a non-valuable junk plane so as to protect the sharp blades of my good planes.\u00a0 As you can imagine, we are taking about 10s of linear feet here so this will take me a while to finish.\u00a0 This is just as well as this stock is a little wet.\u00a0 Once planed, the stock looks really nice, see the before and after pics below.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_459\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/syp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-459\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-459\" title=\"syp\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/syp-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/syp-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/syp-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-459\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clean on the left and needs work on the right<\/p><\/div>\n<p>One other thing, I purchased two &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.toolsforworkingwood.com\/store\/dept\/CGT\/item\/MS-HOLDFAST.XX\/Holdfasts_by_Gramercy_Tools\">Gramercy Hold Fasts<\/a>&#8221; from &#8220;Tools For Working Wood&#8221; on Friday and they were delivered on Monday.\u00a0 A hold fast is a clamping device used on a bench in predrilled holes and is very convenient for holding stock while chieseling, sawing, and chopping mortises to name a few.\u00a0 I added small pieces of leather to the flat ends to help keep from marring my work pieces.\u00a0 Here is a picture of the hold fast in and out of the bench hole.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/holdfast.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-460\" title=\"holdfast\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/holdfast-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/holdfast-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/holdfast-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One interesting factoid about these is they work better in thicker benches (The manufacturer suggests a minimum of 2&#8243;) and not so much in thinner benches.\u00a0 My bench is very thin, it is 3\/4&#8243; and only have one hole bored that is about 5&#8243; deep.\u00a0 I had figured that the 5&#8243; inch hole would work best and the thinner ones would be useless.\u00a0 As it turned out the thinner ones work best.\u00a0 I think the 5&#8243; hole may actually be too deep.\u00a0 I do not want to use them too much on the thinner holes as the hold fasts will probably damage them.\u00a0 I will add a piece of leftover oak flooring to the back of my bench to give the holes more thickness, making them stronger and less likely to be damaged.<\/p>\n<p>When I complete the workbench class this spring, I will finally have a bench made for traditional woodworking and the hold fasts will have a nice place to play.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more, later, on the SYP and spring pole lathe.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I mentioned in my first entry for the Spring Pole Lathe, I will be making regular updates on my progress for this project.\u00a0 We had company this weekend and I had the pleasure to share some shop time with my new friend who&#8217;s name is also Aaron.\u00a0 We had a blast and I hope [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[7,4],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-457","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-tools-i-make","category-tools"],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p5zOwr-7n","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/457","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=457"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/457\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":472,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/457\/revisions\/472"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=457"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=457"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=457"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
