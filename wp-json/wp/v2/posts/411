recently been contemplating a journey into the wild and wonderful world of leather work. \u00a0This is mainly a desire to make items for my tools such as sheaths and various means to protect my tool&#8217;s sharp edges from each other and my skin.<\/p>\n<p>I have several cases and sheathes I have purchased or inherited and I still have several items that need to be protected. \u00a0I have some Axes, adz&#8217; and drawknives in dire need.<\/p>\n<p>This was all pretty back burner stuff until I saw <a href=\"http:\/\/artofmanliness.com\/2012\/11\/30\/how-to-make-a-wallet\/\">this article<\/a> on &#8220;The Art Of Manliness&#8221; website. \u00a0This is a great site for all men, young and old who want to get in touch with their inner manly self. \u00a0The article describes how to build a wallet that will last the rest of your life. \u00a0Not the flimsy crap you buy in a store that look great until you put stuff in it and actually use it. \u00a0I knew I could make this wallet. \u00a0It had a template and great instructions.<\/p>\n<p>I do have some limited experience with working leather. \u00a0Growing up, my neighbor was a multitalented and incredibly smart man. \u00a0One of his hobbies was leather working. \u00a0He made his own trick roping saddle which was beautiful and very functional. \u00a0He graciously and patiently taught me to do basic stuff like tooling and dyeing. \u00a0I made a belt with my name on it (i&#8217;m sure I wore this belt out). \u00a0This was a very fond memory because he took the time to help a curious and eager youngster learn to craft leather. \u00a0He is gone now but definitely not forgotten. \u00a0His attention to detail and drive for excellence have influenced me ever since.<\/p>\n<p>After deciding to make the wallet, I went over to my local Tandy Leather Factory and purchased some leather and other supplies to do the job. \u00a0First off, at Tandy you cannot buy just 1&#8217;x 2&#8242; piece of leather. \u00a0They offer large pieces, scraps or kits. \u00a0I chose scraps as they had some 3-4 oz. scraps big enough for this project. \u00a0With supplies in hand I went home and started working.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I had to do was to print out the pattern in the correct scale. \u00a0The plans say you can print it full size on 11&#215;17 , I suggest you have it printed at a place like Kinko&#8217;s if you want to make one. \u00a0I finally printed the plan in 4 sheets and taped them together. \u00a0I then cut out the individual pieces and used them as the cutting guides for the parts. \u00a0I actually used pushpins (in the hole locations on the corners) to attach the plan and leather to a board and then used a steel rule to cut them out. \u00a0Also I had a old leather awe I bought, mistaking it for a bird cage awe, and it worked great in puncturing holes for the stitches.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/blade_sheath.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

decided I can do leather work and that I actually enjoy it quite a bit. \u00a0I love hand stitching! \u00a0Who knew? \u00a0In the vein of my original intent to make woodworking add-ons I made the small tool sheath for my Veritas Plow plane blades seen above. \u00a0This was from the scraps I had left over from my wallet project. \u00a0Now my blades do not have to hang out in the disgusting duct tape holder they were in, yuck!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/tool_caddy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium

craft tools knocking around in a box, so I hastily added a tool rack to my repurposed Clementine box and the picture below shows the result. \u00a0This is a temporary solution, but so far it is proving quite convenient. \u00a0I see a new woodworking shop project in my future, after I build my spring pole lathe of course.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As woodworking is my main hobby, obsession, meditation etc., I do not usually venture in
