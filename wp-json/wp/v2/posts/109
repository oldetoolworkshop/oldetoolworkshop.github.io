My trial attempts were pretty pathetic, but at the dovetail class I had a hand-tool epiphany: Sharp tools make all the difference in the world!\u00a0 I know this is a simple concept, but until you have experienced the joy that is using a good, sharp chisel, you have not lived\u2026.or at least probably not been successful at dovetail joints.<\/p>\n<p>I decided on a smaller chest to hone my dovetail skills, a travel chest that is roughly 1\/2 the size of the larger one.\u00a0 The intended dimensions were 12x12x24, this is not exactly the golden ratio, but I sized the width to accommodate my largest plane, a 22&#8243; Jointer.\u00a0 This smaller footprint was constructed almost exactly to the same design as the full size ATC with a few exceptions:<\/p>\n<p>1) Stock Thickness.\u00a0 If I went with all dimensions reduced to 1\/2, the stock thickness would be 1\/2&#8243; and I thought that was a little thin so I decided to go to 3\/4&#8243;<\/p>\n<p>2) Instead of sliding trays, I decided to maximize the storage space and make 2 lift-out full width and depth trays.\u00a0 One is\u00a0 1 1\/2&#8243; high and the other 3&#8243; high.\u00a0 This allows me to get a lot more tools in the small chest.\u00a0 The lift-out trays make convenient tool holders while working and makes cleanup after use very quick.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-021.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-902 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-021-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"atc_chest_sm-02\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-021-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-021-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-021-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-021-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-031.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-901 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-031-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"atc_chest_sm-03\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-031-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-031-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-031-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/atc_chest_sm-031-624x468.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>3) The lock is placed on the dust skirt, not on the carcass proper.\u00a0 This was done to accommodate the smaller lock that I used.\u00a0 I choose to only screw the dust skirt to the carcass, though I did let a little squeeze-out remain from the skirts assembly to help with fixing it to the body of the chest.\u00a0 It is not under a lot of strain, so I figured fastening it in this way was OK.\u00a0 What this allows:\u00a0 If the lock ever breaks, I can remove the dust skirt and fix or replace it.<\/p>\n<p>4) No bottom skids.\u00a0 I decided to leave these off because this chest will spend most of its life (with me at least) on a cabinet at a good usable height to access the planes in the bottom and not on a wet or damp floor. I may at some point add thin skids but right now it will stay skidless.<\/p>\n<p>This &#8220;prototype&#8221; exceeded my wildest expectations.\u00a0 I am very pleased with the end product.\u00a0 This will make a very good temporary home to my tools until the full sized one is built and also, be a great traveling chest, when taking classes and such.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well I&#8217;ve done it; I&#8217;ve gone and finished another project!\u00a0 This has been a pretty long project but I am really pleased with the results.
