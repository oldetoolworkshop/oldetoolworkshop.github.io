There have been a lot of old and new texts added recently, so if you&#8217;ve not visited this site in a while, it may be time to go back and check it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When searching, you may want to narrow your search,  just put &#8220;subject:&#8221;hand planes&#8221;&#8221; in the &#8220;Search&#8221; field and check the &#8221;\u00a0Search text contents&#8221; radio button and and you&#8217;ll get a large number of texts listed.  When you get there on the &#8220;Sort By&#8221; bar, hover over the &#8220;Date Archived&#8221;  and click &#8220;Date Added&#8221; menu item to get the latest texts added first. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are generally two types of texts, &#8220;Books to Borrow&#8221; and &#8220;Community Texts&#8221;. You can borrow books from the Books to Barrow section if you create an account. You can freely download most books that are in the Community Texts section without an account. Just click on the text you&#8217;re interested in and it will be displayed on it&#8217;s own page. I like to right-click and choose &#8220;Open Link in New Tab&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the page loads Archive.org shows a preview and reading section at the top and text information and download links in the bottom section. I like the PDF format to portability so I usually click the &#8220;PDF&#8221; or the &#8220;PDF WITH TEXT&#8221; links to get a text searchable PDF link. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These search techniques apply to any subject on Archive .org. This site can be really fun to explore. So go find some cool references and if you find a particular gem. leave a comment so other folks can see it too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also order a new copy of the <a href=\"https:\/\/lostartpress.com\/products\/stanley-catalogue-no-34\">Stanley Tools Catalogue No 34<\/a> (cover at the top of this article) from <a href=\"https:\/\/lostartpress.com\/products\/stanley-catalogue-no-34\">Lost Art Press<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are fun to pursue on days when you just can&#8217;t get into your shop. I have found the old Stanley, Record, Millers Falls etc. catalogs invaluable for helping me identify and sometimes help me repair old planes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next time, keep making shavings and sawdust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peace,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lets face it, I love my planes.
