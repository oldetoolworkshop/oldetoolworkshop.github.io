come in you may ask?\u00a0 Please bear with me and I will explain.<\/p>\n<p>I rested my arm for a week, and took anti-inflammatories, and it was feeling better, although still a little swollen.\u00a0 Then, I made the mistake of using it again to install a storm door that was a Mother&#8217;s Day gift for my very patient wife.\u00a0 It re-injured my elbow so badly that I had to do the unthinkable; I had to cancel my Moravian Workbench class at Roy&#8217;s Woodwright&#8217;s School.\u00a0 I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I realized I would not be able to physically stand up to a solid week of punishing mortise chopping, but I contacted Roy and let him know I was not going to be able to make the class.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward a couple of weeks to this past weekend, and after going to the Doctor and getting some stronger medication and a new arm brace, my injury was doing better.\u00a0 I decided to take it slow and do some limited work.\u00a0 I did some plane refurbishing, which amounted to some sanding of the sole of the plane and blade sharpening.\u00a0 I took frequent rests and iced my elbow after each session.\u00a0 I was not feeling any pain afterwards, and I could tell it was healing.<\/p>\n<p>After doing some deep thinking about my predicament, I surmised that the root cause of the problem was the height of my workbench.\u00a0 I have not discussed my workbench a lot as it is a commercial bench I bought from Grizzly before I knew any better.\u00a0 It&#8217;s funny, for what I paid for this bench, I could have purchased the material for a really nice bench.\u00a0 I have made do with this light-weight, thin-topped, crappy-vised bench-shaped object for almost 3 years now, and I have never adjusted the height.\u00a0 That all changed.\u00a0 I reduced the height of my bench by 4 inches.\u00a0 I must tell you, this really made a huge difference.\u00a0 Planing is easier and so is sawing.<\/p>\n<p>Now we get to the &#8220;Spring Pole Bookshelf&#8221; part:\u00a0 As I was piddling around the shop this weekend, I was cleaning, and I placed s few books on my lathe.\u00a0 They fit nicely on the bed and it got me thinkin&#8217;&#8230;.If I cut a board the same shape as the tail stock, I could use it for a sliding bookend.\u00a0 This was just the small project I felt I could tackle with my limited elbow capacity.<\/p>\n<p>I sawed out the block of wood and drilled a hole for a 1\/2&#8243; dowel rod and inserted the rod after placing the bookend on the lathe bed.\u00a0 I put my woodworking books on the lathe bed and adjusted the new bookend.\u00a0 I cut a wedge to set the bookend in place and it worked great; who needs a lathe when you have such a nice bookshelf!\u00a0 I took a few pics and then went to rest my arm and elbow on some ice.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/2013-05-26-20.54.41.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-531 alignnone\" alt=\"2013-05-26 20.54.41\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/2013-05-26-20.54.41-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/2013-05-26-20.54.41-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/2013-05-26-20.54.41-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I like this design concept and I will probably make a bookshelf similar to this after I complete the spring pole lathe.\u00a0 Yes, I plan to finish the lathe.\u00a0 This bookshelf was only a side-diversion to entertain me until I am physically able to continue the lathe project.<\/p>\n<p>I will publish a list of my books in a later post.\u00a0 This is a combination of deliberate purchases, books I&#8217;ve had for years and lucky finds in the annual library book sale.\u00a0 All of the LAP or <a href=\"http:\/\/lostartpress.com\/\">Lost Art Press<\/a>\u00a0books I own are definitely deliberate purchases.<\/p>\n<p>One side note, I was planning on doing a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theonion.com\">The Onion<\/a>&#8220;-esque post with a title like &#8220;Traditional Woodworker Injures Self in Freak Strain-Related Accident&#8221;
