\u00a0I took it over to my Saw Box, put it up against the side, and said to my friend, Bob, jokingly: \u00a0&#8220;I sure hope it&#8217;s long enough.&#8221; \u00a0It was short by about 3\/16 of an inch.\u00a0 How my heart sank. \u00a0 This meant that I not only had to redo the dovetail, but I also had to create a whole new moulding piece.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_356\" style=\"width: 298px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/a_bit_short.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-356\" class=\" wp-image-356\" title=\"a_bit_short\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/a_bit_short.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"288\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/a_bit_short.jpg 480w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/a_bit_short-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-356\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh the Sorrow!<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Second newbie mistake of the day: \u00a0&#8220;Measure twice and cut once.&#8221; \u00a0Wow, I was batting a thousand. \u00a0You would think given the way this day was going I would quit there, but no; I had to forge on. \u00a0I haven&#8217;t had much time to get in the workshop lately, and I had to make the best use of my time. \u00a0I decided to at least cut out the material and form my new moulding before quitting for the day.<\/p>\n<p>I had a 2&#215;12 board that had a knot-free edge wide enough for the ~2 inch board I needed for the moulding. \u00a0I marked it with my marking gauge and proceeded to cut it out with my trusty old Disston rip saw.\u00a0 I normally like to cut my pieces a little wide and plane them down to size because my hand ripping is not the most accurate&#8230;but it was getting late and I decided to rip close to the line.\u00a0 At first glance, it looked like I finally did something right, but upon closer inspection I noticed I had angled my saw such that I was within the line on the top but shy on the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>Third and final lesson of the day: \u00a0&#8220;Do not take shortcuts on clear materials.&#8221; \u00a0It&#8217;s ok to experiment on crappy material to try to improve your technique, but if you are unsure of an operation, do not try it on a nice piece of wood just to save time.<\/p>\n<p>Given all the above,\u00a0 I think I should have stopped after the second problem and walked away for a while to reflect on what I was doing. \u00a0 I was also lucky I did not injure myself.\u00a0 It is hard to walk away, as I really enjoy my woodworking time, and I like to take full advantage when I can.\u00a0 But the price paid could have been more than just wasted time and material.<\/p>\n<p>This makes me think about the adage: \u00a0&#8220;A bad day in the workshop is better than a good day in the office,&#8221; well maybe not always.<\/p>\n<p>-Aaron<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is there such a thing as a bad day in the workshop?\u00a0 I guess if you gouge yourself with a &#8220;pig sticker&#8221; or slice yourself with a knife, these could be considered bad days.\u00a0 This is not what I am talking about here.
