my first one was ok, but it had a few extra unnecessary cuts. \u00a0Fortunately I foresaw this difficulty and planned ahead with extra long stock, which gave me a couple of tries for each piece.\u00a0 When it came to cutting the critical second cuts on each board, \u00a0I was getting pretty good at it.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a drawing of a mitered dovetail joint\u00a0I found on Mike Ogdon&#8217;s now defunct blog on dovetail joints.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/mitered-dovetails.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-326\" title=\"mitered dovetails\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/mitered-dovetails.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/mitered-dovetails.jpg 640w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/mitered-dovetails-300x154.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The mitered portion of my corner joint is a bit wider than shown in the drawing, in proportion to the dovetails \u00a0in the frame boards of my lid.<\/p>\n<p>One other design choice that I made for the lid was to orient the tails to show on the front and the pins on the side. \u00a0This was done so as the the top board expands it will not &#8220;blow out&#8221; the dovetails. \u00a0I have allowed some expansion room in the top, so this is just a little added insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind I have not glued this top assembly up yet. \u00a0I will not be putting glue in the grooves for the top board, \u00a0I will leave it &#8220;floating&#8221;
