This week we will be focusing on workbenches. Workbenches are, to some, considered workshop furniture. I think this is incorrect; workbenches are a tool, and in my opinion, the most important tool in your shop. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a workbench, you cannot properly hold your project pieces to do basic operations. Oh sure, you can put pieces on saw horses and I have, but a nice bench makes a world of difference when it comes to comfort and efficiency. I can say after finishing my bench, all operations have become 100% better than my old bench. It stays put and does not &#8220;walk&#8221; all around my shop when doing simple planing and it is very stout when chopping mortices and hammering over a leg. Long boards are a breeze. I can work on small pieces and thin pieces too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I will be referencing Chris Schwarz of Lost Art Press and Roy underhill of &#8220;The Woodwright&#8217;s Shop&#8221; a lot in this and the upcoming blogs. Chris and Roy have heavily influenced me and countless others during this renaissance of  hand-tool wood working. Chris and his team at LAP have propelled this craft to levels not seen since at least the early 20th Century.  Roy with his  three decades of woodworking shown on PBS&#8217; &#8220;The Woodwright&#8217;s Shop&#8221; had a very early influence on me personally. I also want to thank the many YouTube content creators (links below) who have also given new life into the craft. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started my seriously fun woodworking adventure late in life (I&#8217;ve been dabbling all my life, but really went all-in around age 50) and with very little knowledge of the craft (more on my lack of knowledge later). I mainly knew about power tools and didn&#8217;t fully digest Roy&#8217;s show content until I actually took a class at his Woodwright&#8217;s School. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Published in 2011, LAP&#8217;s  &#8220;The Anarchist&#8217;s Tool Chest&#8221; was truly a turning point in my understanding of the craft and reinforced my ideals about hand-tool woodworking, self-reliance and the state of todays furniture industry (it sucks by the way). I just finished re-reading &#8220;The Anarchist&#8217;s Tool Chest&#8221; and it is just as fresh and relevant today, 10 as it was ten years ago when it was published. The good news is the state of hand-tool working today is much more widely accepted than a decade ago. There are also more tool makers today that recognize that woodworkers demand quality products and are actually making them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/workshop-edited.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4085\" width=\"206\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/workshop-edited.jpg 275w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/workshop-edited-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px\" \/><figcaption>Crappy 1st workbench<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>My first workbench was purchased with an abundance of enthusiasm and ignorance. Those are a bad combination because the ignorance can lead you to a purchase an item that can kill your enthusiasm. Fortunately, this did not happen in my case. I just realized I just spent too much money (money that could be spent on materials for a real workbench) on a crappy and poorly designed workbench-shaped object.  Okay, so now you know, so please don&#8217;t make the same mistake I did.  Curb your enthusiasm a bit, and do your research before laying out big bucks for anything. Flashy ads and marketing hype are designed to tap into our lizard brains and trick us into wasting our hard-earned cash. Lesson learned; now let&#8217;s talk about real workbenches. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4086\" width=\"899\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo.png 3596w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo-300x113.png 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo-150x56.png 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo-768x288.png 768w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo-1536x577.png 1536w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo-2048x769.png 2048w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/figure1_plate11-roubo-624x234.png 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px\" \/><figcaption>The famous Roubo Plate 11 &#8211; Figure 1 &#8211; 18th Century Workbench<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Great Roubo<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have detailed my Split-Top Roubo Workbench journey on several earlier posts, just click on the <a href=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/category\/workbench\/\">Workbench tag<\/a> under <strong>Categories<\/strong> on the right to read more on those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roubo Workbench above is from A-J Roubo&#8217;s &#8211; L&#8217;Art du Menuisier &#8211; Planche 011 published in 1769. This is what a workbench should look like. Heavy, really heavy, stout legs, and rock-solid joinery. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I chose the Split-Top design to make the bench easier to move. It can be broken down into 6 major pieces and easily transported. You do sacrifice some joint rigidity using breakdown barrel nuts and bolts in the legs and securing the top to the base, but so far I have not had an issue with rigidity and fasteners coming loose. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different workbench designs out there, but I found the Split-Top Roubo design perfect for my needs. I choose the BenchCrafted vises as they are the best metal vises made today. They&#8217;re not cheap, but they&#8217;re very nice and I love using them. They have smooth action and work with little effort. Do not cheap out on bench hardware, you will regret it if you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2059\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4090\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-scaled.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/planing_stop1\/\" class=\"wp-image-4090\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-300x241.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-150x121.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-768x618.jpg 768w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-1536x1235.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-2048x1647.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop1-624x502.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">Peter Ross Planing Stop<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4091\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-scaled.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/planing_stop2\/\" class=\"wp-image-4091\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/planing_stop2-624x624.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\"><em>Peter Ross Planing Stop<\/em> (not installed)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a picture of my new bench stop made by Master Blacksmith, Peter Ross.
