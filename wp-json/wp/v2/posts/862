It had a brass head and brass handle with a duct tape grip.<\/p>\n<p>I could have just left well enough alone and used it happily, but I just had to make it better.<\/p>\n<p>I had to get that duct tape off of there because it was pretty nasty and really old so it was breaking down.\u00a0 This came off with a knife and the brass rod handle was in good shape.\u00a0 I was really struggling on how to properly put a wooden handle of the brass rod.\u00a0 This decision was made for me, as I was cleaning the head the brass rod came right out of the head.<\/p>\n<p>The high end tool manufacturer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lie-nielsen.com\/\">Lie-Nielson<\/a> used to make a really nice cross-peen hammer and I liked the handle shape, so\u00a0 I decided to mimic that shape.<\/p>\n<p>I had to re-drill and enlarge the hole in the hammer head so it would accommodate a wooden handle. I drilled half way through on the top of the head with the next larger size bit so when I wedged the handle it would not would not come off.<\/p>\n<p>I had a nice piece of cherry that was perfect for the job. So 30 minutes on the lathe and I had me a new handle.\u00a0 The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lie-nielsen.com\/\">Lie-Nielson<\/a> cross-peen hammers have a more slender handle than what I made for my handle.\u00a0 I made my handle a little thicker to accommodate the heavier head on my hammer.\u00a0 The hardest part of this whole project was fitting the cylindrical head to the cylindrical handle and getting it to fit.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-876 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380-300x300.png\" alt=\"Brass Hammer\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380-90x90.png 90w, https:\/\/oldetoolworkshop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2380-624x624.png 624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is what I ended up with.
